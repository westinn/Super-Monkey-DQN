# Game AI Project

Deep Q Learning with modificatons to progress in SNES games.
Currently targetting Classic Kong on SNES.

Created basic building blocks before we set up environment fully.
Now utilizing RLE.

# Requirements

To install requirements, run `setup-reqs.sh`.
This will run a simple `pip install -e .` over the `gym-rle` directory to install the library properly.

# Running
Currently to test environment interaction, you can run the `tester.py` in the root of the repo.
`runner.py` should be the final product once we get our DQN implemention functioning.
